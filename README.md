# Aerial_object_detection_tests
Testing different models and datasets for aerial object detection and tracking. I'm using ultralytics for model training an inference and will be using roboflow for annotation. 
The streamlit app was inspired from [here](https://medium.com/@mycodingmantras/building-a-real-time-object-detection-and-tracking-app-with-yolov8-and-streamlit-part-1-30c56f5eb956) and [here](https://lalodatos.medium.com/building-your-own-real-time-object-detection-app-roboflow-yolov8-and-streamlit-part-1-f577cf0aa6e5).
