# Aerial_object_detection_tests
Testing different models and datasets for object detection and tracking and for pose estimation. I'm using ultralytics for model training an inference and will be using roboflow for annotation. 
The streamlit app was inspired from [here](https://medium.com/@mycodingmantras/building-a-real-time-object-detection-and-tracking-app-with-yolov8-and-streamlit-part-1-30c56f5eb956) and [here](https://lalodatos.medium.com/building-your-own-real-time-object-detection-app-roboflow-yolov8-and-streamlit-part-1-f577cf0aa6e5).

Initially testing pre-trained models. Pose estimation:
